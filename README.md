# vgio
interactive svg app powered by AngularJS

### Whats this...
vgio is an attempt to fuse 3 things - video , svg and interaction.I am yet to figure out its true form...but it looks interesting at the moment.
Its also an attempt to give a flat and light feel to videos.

### a short demo

###features...
   * vgio can be played full like any other video 
   * a user can trigger selective play as well
   * scalability is no issue 
   * plugin free as its pure html/svg
